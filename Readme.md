**1. Short Summary**: This is a web data analyzer that handles a local database that comes from FMS at big-large mining companies.
  - How does it look like?:

#### Features:


1. ##### Cycle time handler:
    - It consults the local database and gets:
       * Routes: Its distance and weights routes based on queue time. *Â¿Why do I do it?*
            > To watch routes with bad performance. It is just to analyze better

        **Why do we need this?** So you can decide whether to change truck assignment or keep them going.

2. ##### Match factor tab:

    - Is it that we need to add/substract truck from a specific loader?. *The app handles it based on the well-know formula*
